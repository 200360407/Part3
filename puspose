Unit testing
The purpose of this part3 is to unit testing of controller so that I can prevent manual testing of every method.
To do all that things i install Moq in my project and create a test class
1.I made childrenControllerTest.
2. Modify childrenController.cs
3. Created 2 repository for controller named as "MockchildrenRepository" and "EFchildrenRepository".
